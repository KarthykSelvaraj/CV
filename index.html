            <p>As an Engineer I was always passionate about technologies after working for 2 years in Automation industry in 
                cross functional team I found was more fasicnated towards the technology I have involved myself 
                in to all teams(Software,Mechanical,Electronics and Electrical) I found that it was more interesting 
                for me to involve myself in to dealing software part so I figured my interset and I 
                setted my path in this way of learning web development and I am really looking forward how much easy I can make somebodies life.
